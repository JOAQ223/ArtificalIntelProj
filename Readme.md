# project to portofolio as basic ML

###  Starting to do the EDA

    - get the description of the data set with df.describe , df.information() , or more 
    - Understand the structur if the read me has more detail explination 
    -  Start to divide the type of data and encoding ordinal data 
    -  See  how to best handle the Nan values and duplicate data 
    - Doing some simple visualiation of the data to choose the correct model type 

### Starting with Test and Train 
    - load all the  libraries like tensorFLow , Sklearn , etc 
    - decide all the parametrs for the model that are choosen , learn ration ,activation function etc, loss function ,etc
    - Start to train the model and  plot the results (accuracy , loss , f1 ,recall ,etc )

### make the evaluation of the Model 
    - evaluate  the perfomance with new data 
    - Data visualtion of the capiabilites of the modell 


### make the GUI for the model 
    -Desing a simple gui for the User
    -Test the GUI
